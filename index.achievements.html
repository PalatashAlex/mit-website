 The idea for writing a scientific paper on solar research came to me because in 2022, I conducted observations of a solar event while serving as the president of the astronomy club. At that time, many people gathered, and I explained the event to them. A television crew also came, and I gave an interview about the observation.

<h3>Computer modeling of solar eclipses in Transcarpathia in the past and future</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The work examines the fundamentals of the theory of solar eclipses, the physical nature of the Moon, its motion, and its role in the occurrence of different types of eclipses. It also provides a detailed description of astronomical phenomenon modeling, in particular the algorithm for finding eclipses using the electronic planetarium REDSHIFT-7, with accompanying tables and maps of eclipse circumstances. Using another electronic planetarium, STELLARIUM-0.12.4, visualizations of the main phases of several total, annular, and partial eclipses of the past and future were created. Detailed lists and maps are provided for some total, annular, and partial eclipses that occurred in Transcarpathia over the past 350 years and will occur in the next 150 years. The relevance of this work lies in demonstrating the importance not only of astronomical knowledge but also of the ability to apply it for reconstructing historical CVCALLDÔºö</p>

<p><strong>The positive aspects:</strong> systematic and coherent presentation of material, independently conducted research, and the ability to work in library archives, obtaining valuable information.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Solar eclipses are among the most fascinating astronomical events. I wanted not only to study their physics but also to show how astronomy can explain historical events and inspire students to explore space.</p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modeled eclipses with REDSHIFT-7 and generated tables and maps of their circumstances</li>
<li>Used STELLARIUM-012.4 to visualize eclipse phases</li>
<li>Analyzed historical texts (Huklyvskyi Chronicle, Song of Terrible Years, 19th-century "Mesiatsoslov") to find cultural mentions of eclipses</li>
<li>Compared results of simulations with historical evidence</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Produced complete chronology of eclipses for 500 years (350 past, 150 future)</li>
<li>Generated visualizations and maps for full, annular, and partial eclipses</li>
<li>Verified historical sources by aligning astronomical predictions with documented events</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modernization of Ukraine‚Äôs locomotives</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The presented work is dedicated to improving the technical characteristics of locomotives. I have summarized the available solutions to the operational problems of outdated locomotives on Ukraine‚Äôs railways and proposed my own ideas in this area. After a thorough analysis of the issues, I set myself the goal of developing a more advanced scheme for protecting the electric motor from runaway, as well as finding a way to use rheostatic braking more efficiently on diesel locomotives.

The relevance of this work lies in the improvement of locomotive design, which will allow locomotives to better meet the needs of the transport network.

The positive aspects of this research work include the systematic and coherent presentation of material, the presence of independently conducted research, and the ability to work in institutions such as depots, gaining valuable practical information.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Living near a railway station, I repeatedly observed the problems that arose during the operation of diesel and electric locomotives. That is why I wanted to create a practical, hands-on solution to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and demonstrate sustainable engineering. </p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Studied diesel locomotive braking systems and energy losses.</li>
<li>Studied electric locomotive traction motors and problems with them</li>
<li>Created diagrams showing system integration into locomotives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Described the prototypes of the devices</li>
<li>Produced diagrams and instructions for implementing the system.</li>
</ul>

üèÜ Another major achievement of mine this year was winning 3rd place at the All-Ukrainian Debate Tournament. From October 10 to October 12, 2024, I participated in the national stage of the ‚ÄúEnvironment and Society‚Äù Debate Competition as the captain of the team ‚ÄúEkovarta.‚Äù
<p>Throughout the event, the members of my team demonstrated creativity, innovation, and strong critical thinking. They successfully made balanced and complex decisions, showing both competitiveness and the ability to adapt to modern challenges.</p>
<p>Under my leadership, ‚ÄúEkovarta‚Äù proudly took third place at the national level.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the locomotive modernization proposals I presented during the competition has the potential to produce a positive environmental impact.</p>

üåç This year has been difficult and unusual for me, as I was forced to move to another country due to the war.
<p>However, I didn‚Äôt give up and continued developing my projects. I improved my device for electric locomotives and built a small working prototype.</p>
<p>This project earned recognition at both the ‚ÄúInventorUA‚Äù competition and the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (–ú–ê–ù), where it received high placements and became the winner of the regional stage.</p>

<h3>Traction motor anti-wheelslip protection device</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this work, I summarized the available solutions to the problem of wheelslip on Ukraine‚Äôs railways and proposed my own ideas in this area. By analyzing existing solutions, I identified shortcomings in the traction motor anti-wheelslip protection system. The wheelslip protection system on locomotives‚Äîimplemented as a wheelslip relay (WSR)‚Äîin certain situations cannot prevent motor runaway. Therefore, I set myself the goal of developing a scheme to protect the electric motor from runaway. This time, I worked not only on the theoretical part but also aimed to demonstrate an experimental prototype. To achieve this, I found a suitable place for experiments and gathered the necessary materials. In the end, I was able to design and build a tangible model of the development.

The positive aspects of this research work include the systematic and coherent presentation of material, independently conducted research, and the ability to work in institutions such as depots, consulting with specialists in this field.
</p>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> After the success of my previous work, I decided to continue the project. This time, I focused on electric locomotives and created an experimental model of the device. </p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Studied locomotive systems and identified conditions leading to wheelslip.</li>
<li>Designed a protection from wheelslip.</li>
<li>Created schematics and structural diagrams for modernization.</li>
<li>Collected operational data from railway depots to validate proposed solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a functional design for a wheelslip protection system.</li>
<li>Provided diagrams for integration into existing locomotives.</li>
<li>Proposed methods to improve operational efficiency and safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these achievements represents a moment of curiosity, effort and growth. Whether it was repairing a complex device, building systems with Flowcode, or competing in science Olympiads, I always aimed to go beyond the surface ‚Äî to understand, to improve, and to innovate.</p>
<p>I don't view challenges as obstacles ‚Äî I see them as opportunities to learn and evolve. My passion for electronics, programming and physics is not limited to school projects; I find joy in solving problems and building solutions that have real-world impact.</p>
<p>I believe that my journey is only beginning. I am eager to join communities that value creativity and collaboration. Georgia Tech, with its culture of invention and excellence, is the place where I know I will thrive.</p>
