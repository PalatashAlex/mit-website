    The idea for writing a scientific paper on solar research came to me because in 2022, I conducted observations of a solar event while serving as the president of the astronomy club. At that time, many people gathered, and I explained the event to them. A television crew also came, and I gave an interview about the observation.

    The following year, I began working on a scientific project related to the modernization of locomotives. This project won 3rd place at the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (–ú–ê–ù).

    This project is dedicated to the modernization of locomotives. In it, I described my own method for protecting the traction motors of an electric locomotive from wheel slip. I also presented a personal development aimed at improving the performance of diesel locomotives during rheostatic braking. I plan to continue developing and patenting all of these innovations. I am confident that the laboratories at your university will help me achieve this. I should also add that this project was carried out with the support of Uzhhorod National University and railway specialists.

    <p>Here you can watch a news segment featuring my interview, where I share some comments about this project. Please include English subtitles.</p>

    Another major achievement of mine this year was winning 3rd place at the All-Ukrainian Debate Tournament. From October 10 to October 12, 2024, I participated in the national stage of the ‚ÄúEnvironment and Society‚Äù Debate Competition as the captain of the team ‚ÄúEkovarta.‚Äù

    Throughout the event, the members of my team demonstrated creativity, innovation, and strong critical thinking. They successfully made balanced and complex decisions, showing both competitiveness and the ability to adapt to modern challenges.

    Under my leadership, ‚ÄúEkovarta‚Äù proudly took third place at the national level.

    <p>Moreover, one of the locomotive modernization proposals I presented during the competition has the potential to produce a positive environmental impact.</p>

    This year has been difficult and unusual for me, as I was forced to move to another country due to the war.

    However, I didn‚Äôt give up and continued developing my projects. I improved my device for electric locomotives and built a small working prototype.

    This project earned recognition at both the ‚ÄúInventorUA‚Äù competition and the Junior Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (–ú–ê–ù), where it received high placements and became the winner of the regional stage.

    <p>Below is a photo of me during the presentation of my project.</p>

    This time, I faced many challenges, as I had to present my project from another country. Nevertheless, I succeeded.

    Despite all the obstacles, my project won the Ukrainian Future program ‚Äî the business incubator. As a result, I received admission to participate in the 2025 pre-incubation programs, including:

    <p>‚Ä¢ BizCamp, implemented in partnership with the U.S.-based youth entrepreneurship organization NFTE</p>

    <p>‚Ä¢ UF Startup School Beginner</p>

    <p>‚Ä¢ and Innovation Days, a competitive program aimed at supporting sustainable entrepreneurship.</p>

    These awards were granted to finalists whose posters, according to expert evaluations, demonstrated the highest potential for practical implementation and future commercialization. These programms mean a lot to me, as I‚Äôve mentioned earlier ‚Äî I have strong ambitions to continue developing and advancing my inventions.

    My other activities in 2025:

    <p>-was an active participant of the FPV Club.</p>

    Due to the current circumstances in my country, innovative fields like FPV drone technology have been developing rapidly. 

    As someone who is passionate about learning new things, I was one of the first students to actively explore this area ‚Äî I learned not only how to pilot FPV drones but also how to assemble and build them from scratch.

    <p>Below, you can see one of the FPV drones I assembled and successfully piloted. Later, this drone was sent to the army, where it was successfully used.</p>

<h2 class="centered-topic">Reflection</h2>

  <div class="achievement-text">

    <p>Each of these achievements represents a moment of curiosity, effert and growth. Whether it was repairing a complex device, building system with Flowcode or competing in science Olympias, I was always aimed to go beyond the surface - to understand, to improve and to innovate. </p>

    <p>I don't view challenges as obstacles - I see them as opportunities to learn and evolve. My passion for electronics, programming and physics is not limited to school projects, I find joy in solving problems and building solutions that have real-world impact.</p>

    <p>I believe that my juorney is only beginning. I am eager to join communities that value creativity and collaboration. MIT, with its culture of invention and excellence, is the kind of place where I know I will thrive. </p>
